# KSP Tools

This repository contains a few python calculators/ tools that I use in Kerbal Space Program (KSP).<br />
All of these files require that you have python installed, preferably version 3.6 or later<br />
These are all GUI programs, which means it doesn't just open in a cmd window as per usual, but in a nice GUI interface.

## Getting Started

The rest of this readme explains how to get the tools running on pretty much any computer.

### Prerequisites/ Instalation

In order to run python files, you need to download its interpreter, as python wasn't built to compile files into executables! <br />
To do this, simple go to <a href=https://www.python.org/downloads>the python install page</a> and grab the newest version of python

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language I used
* [PyCharm(Community)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - The IDEA I used to develop the tools
